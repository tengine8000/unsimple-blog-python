# Unsimple Blog Python Version
## An ongoing blog app I continuously build for the purpose of learning new things about Python and its toolkits
---

### Purpose 
The aim of this project is not to rush through finish a simple blog but to keep me learning and adding new useful features to what started out as a simple blog. 
It's more like a dairy of my applied knowledge of Python and relevant libraries, frameworks, etc., to a potential real-world blogging app.

Learning is never complete without applying and sharing the knowledge gained.

### Features
This is going to be the Python backend component to a fully featured blog. The frontend is built with NuXTJS
